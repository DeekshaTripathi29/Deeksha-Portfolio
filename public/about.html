<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Deeksha Tripathi, a dedicated and highly skilled software engineer with a passion for frontend
  development, backend testing, and collaborative problem-solving. With over 2.6 years of professional experience,
  I've honed my expertise in creating responsive web applications and ensuring seamless user experiences across 
  various platforms.</p>

<p>During my tenure at Decentro Tech Pvt. Ltd., I led backend testing for the India Payment Module, utilizing a
   range of tools including REST API, SQL, Postman, and Jira. My proficiency in test design, execution, and 
   documentation contributed to informed decision-making and optimized software integration processes.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I worked at Volvo Group India Pvt. Ltd., where I spearheaded the development of intuitive web 
  applications, closely collaborating with backend teams to integrate frontend interfaces with server-side logic.
   Leveraging technologies such as React.js and Bootstrap5, I prioritized modular component design and code 
   maintainability.</p>

<p>My journey into the world of software engineering began at L & T Technology Services, where I developed 
  responsive web apps using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with a focus on enhancing user experience through 
  dynamic UIs.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong foundation in communication, problem-solving, and 
  cross-functional collaboration. I thrive in dynamic team environments and am always eager to take on new 
  challenges that push the boundaries of innovation.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I've had the opportunity to showcase my public speaking and engagement skills through hosting
   events at Volvo Group. I've also been recognized for my contributions, receiving the employee of the month SPOT
    Award.

  I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University, where I also 
  participated in the Bhangra World Record, showcasing my enthusiasm for teamwork and community involvement.</p>

<p>I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects and making a meaningful impact in the 
  field of software engineering. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to bring ideas to life!</p>
